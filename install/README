KORA Requirements:

KORA requires a web server, PHP 5.1.3 or newer, MySQL 5.0.3 or newer, and a mail transfer agent that the PHP mail() call will utilize for sending e-mail about account activation.

Upgrade instructions:
If you are upgrading from pre 2.0.0-beta:
Upgrading requires an extra step due to the internationalization implementation.  The entire procedure is outlined below:
* Create a backup of your KORA database (as a precaution).
* Copy your conf.php file from the previous version of KORA you are running into the includes folder of this version.
* Copy (or move) the files and style folders from the previous version of KORA to this version.
* Rename the KORA-2.0.0-beta folder to whatever name you want to use (assumedly the name of your old KORA install).
* Move this folder into place of the old folder
* Navigate to BASE_URL/install/runOnce.php in a browser and make sure the script runs successfully.  If not check your conf.php settings.
* Disable or remove the install folder from being web-accessible.
* Navigate to BASE_URL and log in, the "Your database is out of date..." message should be displayed.  Click on "System Management" and then click on "Update database layout".  Ensure this completes successfully.  You may need to run it more than once.
* Update the styles and control lists using the other buttons on the System Management screen.

If you are upgrading from 2.0.0-beta and later:
* Overwrite all the files in your KORA install with the new files.  Be careful not to completely overwrite your files directory or your includes/config.php file.  Also make sure the install directory is disabled or removed.
* Navigate to BASE_URL and log in, the "Your database is out of date..." message should be displayed.  Click on "System Management" and then click on "Update database layout".  Ensure this completes successfully.  You may need to run it more than once.
* Update the styles and control lists using the other buttons on the System Management screen.

For all updates you must do the following:

* Add the following line to includes/conf.php if it doesn't already exist: define('extractedFiles',fileDir.'extractedFiles/');
* Ensure that fileDir (default is files/ ) has a folder called 'extractedFiles' and a folder called 'awaitingApproval'.  Be sure both are writeable by the webserver user.
